geo-alert
=========

This is the project I built at Louisville Hackathon (http://www.greaterlouisville.com/HackAThon/wthack/) and won the third place.  The idea is to create a mobile app that uses the open crime data of Louisville (http://portal.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/crime-data) to alert travellers when they are in insecure area of the city.  We use play2, scala, javascript, and phonegap.

This part of the code is for backend REST API.  It allows the mobile app to query crime report based on location, distance range, and time range.
